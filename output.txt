This appears to be a test/greeting rather than a specific request for code review or implementation\nc. Key information: The user is just saying \"hey\" - this is a simple greeting/test\nd. No specific tasks are being requested beyond acknowledging the greeting\ne. Since this is just a test/greeting, I should respond appropriately and briefly\n\nThe user is likely just testing that the Claude Code Actions integration is working. I should provide a friendly acknowledgment and perhaps explain what I can help with.\n\nSince this is just a greeting/test with no specific request, I don't need to:\n- Read any files\n- Make any code changes\n- Create any complex todo lists\n- Do any implementation work\n\nI should just update my comment with a friendly response acknowledging the greeting and explaining what I can help with.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":9,"cache_creation_input_tokens":18828,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard"}},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5695fb79-8efa-4c09-91f4-c347015a942d"}
